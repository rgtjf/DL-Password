## Machine Learning, Hack Passwords
- blog: https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/machine-learning-ashley-madison-passwords-a45c1702b953#.awagqfpib
- predict the next words in a sentence (tutorial, tensorflow, word2vec https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/word2vec/)
- Question: can a deep learning model exploit regularities in sentences to guess the passwords that are considered safe?
	- for example, give the first, third, fourth character to predict the password

# How to implenment a Deep Learning System
Ref to above RNN-Passwords and https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn which implenmented by lua.


## Idea: other sequence to sequence model or neural language model
